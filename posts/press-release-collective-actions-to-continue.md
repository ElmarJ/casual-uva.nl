Dear Management,





Following a collective vote among the striking departments—based on the responses of leadership to Casual UvA's strike demands—a motion has passed to **continue the strike**. Due to a lack of urgency and transparency, we are not confident in how the proposed Central HR policy will be implemented at various organisational levels. To be clear, we do see promise in the opportunities it may afford but are not prepared to cease actions without meaningful engagement. As it stands, too many of our questions have gone unanswered, too many of our requests have been ignored.





To mitigate the impacts of these actions on our students, the eight striking departments have agreed to **release Block 4 grades** within 15 working days. Further, our marking strike action will now **apply to Block 5 grades** with immediate effect. We will refrain from grading any remaining or upcoming assignments for Block 5 courses, including, but not limited to, final examinations. We agreed on this route by a clear majority decision as a symbol of good faith, based on our relationships with our students, and in hopes that we are closer to a managerial solution. For now though, the pressure needs to remain to take our needs seriously. 

We petition for the original conditions to be met and will remain on strike until they are. We are no longer interested in discussing options, but in implementing solutions. We will release a detailed manifesto of our concerns to management to inform solution-oriented discussions and binding policy recommendations. **We demand specifics of the Central HR Policy and department commitments to the following**:





 **1. Permanent Contracts**

 **2. Workload Transparency**

 **3. Professional Development**





Our action group strives to improve the working conditions of those on temporary contracts at the university, which indirectly benefits our students, colleagues, and other stakeholders. We would like to thank those who support us in solidarity and commend the incredibly brave population of over 100 junior teachers who are speaking up for change by joining us in this act.

Casual UvA is in talks with more departments across the university and calling on solidarity and participation from students and staff. We are supported in these efforts nationally by 0.7 and Casual Academy. Please visit our website and contact us to learn more about how you can support our mission against casualisation.

In solidarity,



**Casual UvA**
