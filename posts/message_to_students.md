Dear students,

Happy Friday and happy May break! We hope you have restful plans for the coming week. 

We wish to update you on the status of the strike. We have now had meetings with the dean of the FMG (Agneta Fischer) and the president of the CvB (Geert ten Dam) to discuss our working and teaching conditions. The conversations were productive and we recognise promise in the proposals discussed at each level. We are deliberating on how to proceed as a collective and will release another update soon. 

Thank you for your solidarity and patience as we work towards an outcome for better education. We also understand that some of you may be frustrated by delayed grades, and apologise for the inconvenience this may cause.  

However, this action highlights how casualisation has negatively impacted your education long before our actions. The lack of job security, professional development, and realistic work hour allocation have impeded the facilitation of the education you all deserve. 

Please know we do not want to continue unnecessarily. We want to end the strike - but we need leadership to take action and accountability. 

We empower you to harness your energy and direct it to leadership: encourage them to take concrete steps to ensure better contracts, to ultimately assure the best education possible for you. 

Thank you for your ongoing support and understanding. Teachers and students united will never be divided. 

In solidarity,

Junior Lecturers of Striking Departments
