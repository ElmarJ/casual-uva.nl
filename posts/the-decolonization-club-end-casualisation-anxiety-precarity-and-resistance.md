author: Casual UvA
summary: 'Read "End Casualisation: Anxiety, Precarity, and Resistance", an essay
  by Lukas Ziel about casualization and the Casual UvA strike: "The worst
  effects of casualisation are felt by already marginalised lecturers, gendered
  and racial pay gaps exacerbating already precarious conditions. And as so very
  often, the university is more concerned with attention being called to the
  problem, rather than with the problem itself."'

Naturally, I couldn’t resist, typed it in on YouTube and moments later all three of us were singing along to this anti-capitalist anthem, barely getting by, all taking and no giving. And while many of us have been working ourselves to the brink of death, professionally, scholastically, or otherwise, one of the most important days in working-class history has come around. May Day.*
