### A﻿bout the demonstration #WeAreNotDisposable

1 year since our marking strike, our colleagues are still being replaced. Casual UvA organized a demonstration to express our continuing frustrations on April 20, 2023. Around 150 lecturers and students attended to support the cause. The demonstration was covered in the press by outlets like [AT5](https://www.at5.nl/artikelen/220068/protest-op-de-uva-voor-vaste-contracten-we-zijn-wegwerpdocenten) and [Parool](https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/weer-protest-tegen-tijdelijke-contracten-uva-wij-zijn-geen-wegwerpdocenten~bd8c1aed/).
