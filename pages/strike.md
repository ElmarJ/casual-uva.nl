## What?

D4-Teachers[^1] at multiple departments at the UvA have called a marking strike. That means that they have stopped entering grades into the system.[^2].

## Participating departments/programs:

- Sociology
- Anthropology
- Political Science
- Interdisciplinaire Sociale Wetenschappen (ISW)
- Future Planet Studies
- BÃ¨ta-Gamma
- Human Geography


## Why?
The strike is about three core issues: teachers ...
- ... are doing more than what they are paid for (both in terms of tasks and hours),
- ... are kept on temporary contracts,
- ... are not getting any/sufficient support in terms of professional development

## Why now?
- At this point, universities and labour unions are re-negotiating the collective labour agreement for university staff (CAO).
- In the past rounds of negotiations, the positions/interests of D4-teachers have been insufficiently addressed.
- By having the strike now, we want to prevent this from happening again.

## What are the demands?
- A public, formal commitment of the CvB to permanent contracts for structural work
- A public, formal commitment of the CvB to professional development opportunities
- Concrete steps against structural overwork

## Impact on students?
Given the (increasingly) important role D4-teachers play in university education we believe our demands are also in the interest of students. Fairly paid teachers with (the prospect of building) experience are better teachers. 

Still, we recognize that at least on the short term, the marking strike might cause discomfort.

We would like to emphasize that we are not taking this course of action lightly. In fact, we have been spending countless of hours of our free time to build and improve teaching material, without proper recognition or serious career prospects, because we care deeply about students and our classes.

We hope, therefore, that students understand that any frustration about the discomfort should be targeted at the circumstances that drove us to this action.
