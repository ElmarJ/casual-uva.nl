We are a collective of employees on temporary contracts, including representatives from a range of departments, at the University of Amsterdam.

On April 1 2022 [we announced a collective grading strike](/strike/), which has been [suspended since June 7 2022](https://casual-uva.nl/posts/casual-uva-to-suspend-strike-and-monitor-implementation/), awaiting the implementation of [the new UvA Lecturer Policy](https://www.uva.nl/en/content/news/news/2022/04/new-uva-lecturer-policy.html).

1 year after the strike, we decided to organize a new demonstration on April 20, due to continuing frustrations about our colleagues being replaced during the implementation phase of the new policy. **[We are not disposable!](https://casual-uva.nl/demo/)**
